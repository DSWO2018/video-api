This is the video-api backend based on Play Framework.  Please see the documentation at <https://www.playframework.com/documentation/latest/Home> for more details.

## Running

Run this using [sbt](http://www.scala-sbt.org/).  If you downloaded this project from <http://www.playframework.com/download> then you'll find a prepackaged version of sbt in the project directory:

```bash
sbt run
```

And then go to <http://localhost:9001> to see the running web application.

There are several demonstration files available in this template.

## Filters

- Filters.scala:

  Creates the list of HTTP filters used by your application.

- ExampleFilter.scala
